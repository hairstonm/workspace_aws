# Weceem CMS Application

This is the source code for the free Open Source Weceem Content Management System built on [Grails](http://grails.org).

The code uses the [Weceem plugin](http://github.com/jCatalog/weceem-plugin) to provide the CMS functionality, 
and the [Weceem Spring Security plugin](http://github.com/jCatalog/weceem-spring-security) to add user authentication.
This application code itself adds little more than the user administration interface. You can build this application to
produce a ready-to-use WAR file of the CMS.

It is now compatible with **Grails 2.4.x**, current released version: **1.4** [release notes](http://jira.jcatalog.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+WCM+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%221.4%22)

For the latest updates and release information visit [Weceem site](http://weceem.org) and follow [@weceem](https://twitter.com/weceem) on twitter.

Full documentation about Weceem plugin is available on the [GitHub](http://jcatalog.github.io/weceem-plugin)
